# Ames Housing Price Prediction Top 300
This project is a personal endeavor to predict the final price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa using a dataset with 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of the homes. The goal of this project is to improve my skills in data science and machine learning by applying various techniques to make accurate predictions.

## Data Description
The dataset provided for this project includes information on residential homes in Ames, Iowa, with 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of the homes, including features such as the number of bedrooms, the proximity to an east-west railroad, and the height of the basement ceiling. The goal is to use this data to predict the final price of each home.

Project Objectives
To apply feature engineering techniques to find new and innovative ways to use the provided data to make accurate predictions.
To use advanced regression techniques such as random forest and gradient boosting to build models and make predictions.
To improve my understanding of data exploration, visualization, and model evaluation.
## Getting Started
To begin this project, I will start by acquiring the dataset and familiarizing myself with the provided data. I will then perform data cleaning and preprocessing, as well as explore and visualize the data to gain insights and identify patterns.

Once I have a good understanding of the data, I will start building and training my models using the provided data. I will evaluate the performance of my models and iterate on my approach to improve the accuracy of my predictions.

Finally, I will document my process, results, and findings in a clear and well-organized manner.

This project is an exciting and challenging personal undertaking, and I am eager to see the results of my work.

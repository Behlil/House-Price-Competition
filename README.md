## Introduction

This project is a playground competition on Kaggle, which aims to predict the final price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa based on 79 explanatory variables. The dataset provides a rich collection of information about the homes, including features such as the number of bedrooms, the size of the lot, and the proximity to certain amenities.

## Competition Description

The goal of this competition is to correctly predict the final price of each home in the dataset. The dataset contains 79 explanatory variables that describe almost every aspect of the residential homes in Ames, Iowa. This competition is a great opportunity to practice your skills in feature engineering and advanced regression techniques such as random forest and gradient boosting.

## Practice Skills

- Creative feature engineering: You will need to come up with creative ways to extract meaningful information from the dataset and use it to improve your predictions.

- Advanced regression techniques: You will need to use machine learning techniques such as random forest and gradient boosting to build accurate models.

## Getting Started

1. Go to https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data and download the train.csv and test.csv files.

2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Begin by exploring the data and creating a baseline model.

4. Experiment with different feature engineering techniques and advanced regression models to improve your predictions.

## Submitting Your Results

You can submit your results to the competition by following the instructions on the Kaggle website. Please make sure to read and accept the competition rules before making any submissions.

## Conclusion
